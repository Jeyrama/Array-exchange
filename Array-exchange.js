/*
It's time for some array exchange! The objective is simple -
exchange the elements of two arrays in-place in a way that their new content is also reversed.

Example:
  const myArray = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
  const otherArray = [1, 2, 3];

  exchangeWith(myArray, otherArray);

  myArray => [3, 2, 1]
  otherArray => ['c', 'b', 'a']
